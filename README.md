# Lucci

A Swift library for dealing with money and currency. Inspired by Ruby Money. 

## Introduction 

Lucci attempts to be a Swift library for dealing with money and currency. It is heavily inspired by the [Ruby Money gem](https://github.com/RubyMoney/money). 

## Origin of the name

I simply looked for a [slang term for money](http://genius.com/Rap-genius-slang-dictionary-money-lyrics/) that was short and that wasn't already an existing GitHub repository. 

If the word "Lucci" is offensive in another language, please let me know and I'll change it.
