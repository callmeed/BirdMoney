A Swift library for dealing with money and currency. Inspired by Ruby Money. 

## Introduction 

Centesimo attempts to be a Swift library for dealing with money and currency. It is heavily inspired by the [Ruby Money gem](https://github.com/RubyMoney/money). 

Goals: 

* Provide a class for defining a money object and its properties
* Allow easy string formatting of money and currency
* Avoid floating point errors in certain operations
* Provide a way to do currency conversions

## Origin of the name

I simply looked for a monetary unit that wasn't already an existing GitHub repository. Centesimo fit the bill. Some coins even have birds on them:
